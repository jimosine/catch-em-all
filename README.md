# Catch 'em all!

Catch 'em all is an Angular web application where users can view and collect all Pokémons from the first generation.

After logging in with a username, the user is shown the entire catalogue of pokemons and they can start catching them by navigating the pages and clicking on the heart icon. 

After building up a collection, users can navigate to their **Trainer** page where they can view their pokémons and release them if they want to.


## Usage

The application is deployed at the following address: https://catch-em-all-jimosine.vercel.app/

If you want to see the data that is stored, the endpoint for the API server is: https://jb-lost-in-translation-api-production.up.railway.app/trainers


## Install

You can also run this application on your own machine by following these steps:

1. Clone the catch-em-all repository

2. Add API credentials to the `environment` files. For the key, contact @jimosine and replace the `apiKey` const

3. Open a terminal and run `npm install` while in the correct directory to install all the required dependencies.

4. Run `ng serve -o` in the same directory to start the application. 
You are now redirected to the website, or you can now access the application at http://localhost:4200/ in your favorite browser

5. Stop the app by typing `CTRL + C` in the terminal.
